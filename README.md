## Introduction

This project is the result of combining two of my passions: **photography** and **web development**.

Apart from building a site for sharing the photos I take, I also wanted to improve my skills as front-end developer 
using the following technologies:

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) 
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run serve

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
